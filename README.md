# FBGroupUserAnalysis
Given a Facebook Group ID, this program collects data on each user that has posted, commented, or liked anything in the group using Facebook's Graph API.

This program will cache Facebook requests, and write two other files: a JSON file containing data on every user, and a txt file containing a report naming the top contributors of the Facebook group. To use the program, you must know the Facebook group ID of the group you want to analyze.

I was an instructor for a programming course, and this program was originally written to view which students were most active in a private group for our course, so that the instructional team could give them credit.
